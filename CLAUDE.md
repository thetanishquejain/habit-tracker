# Claude Code Development Guidelines

## Project Overview

This is a habit tracker application built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to create and track daily habits, view streaks, and analyze their progress with statistics and visualizations.

**Documentation**: See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for the full project roadmap and milestone checklists.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Feature Branch Workflow

**🔴 NEVER COMMIT DIRECTLY TO `main` BRANCH 🔴**

All development work must be done on feature branches. This ensures:
- The `main` branch remains stable and production-ready
- Changes can be reviewed before integration
- Easy rollback if issues arise
- Clear development history
- Isolated development without conflicts

---

## Git Workflow

### 1. Creating a Feature Branch

Before starting any work, create a new feature branch from `main`:

```bash
# Ensure you're on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Working on Your Branch

Make your changes and commit regularly:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Or stage specific files
git add src/components/NewComponent.tsx

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add habit creation form component"
```

### 3. Pushing Your Branch

Push your feature branch to the remote repository:

```bash
# First time pushing a new branch
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# Subsequent pushes
git push
```

### 4. Merging to Main

Once your feature is complete and tested:

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge your feature branch
git merge feature/your-feature-name

# Push to remote
git push origin main

# Optional: Delete the feature branch
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
```

## Branch Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive branch names with prefixes:

| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feature/` | New features or enhancements | `feature/streak-badge` |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes | `fix/date-calculation-bug` |
| `docs/` | Documentation updates | `docs/update-readme` |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring (no functional changes) | `refactor/state-management` |
| `test/` | Adding or updating tests | `test/habit-service-tests` |
| `chore/` | Maintenance, dependencies, tooling | `chore/update-dependencies` |

### Examples

```bash
git checkout -b feature/habit-calendar-view
git checkout -b fix/streak-calculation-error
git checkout -b docs/add-api-documentation
git checkout -b refactor/extract-date-utils
git checkout -b test/add-habit-form-tests
git checkout -b chore/configure-eslint
```

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain **what** changed and **why**:

### Format

```
<type>: <brief description>

<optional detailed explanation>
```

### Good Examples

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add habit creation modal with form validation"
git commit -m "fix: Correct streak calculation for edge cases"
git commit -m "refactor: Extract date utilities to separate module"
git commit -m "docs: Add component usage examples to README"
git commit -m "test: Add unit tests for streak calculator"
git commit -m "chore: Update Tailwind CSS to v3.4.0"
```

### Bad Examples

❌ `git commit -m "fixed stuff"`
❌ `git commit -m "update"`
❌ `git commit -m "WIP"`
❌ `git commit -m "asdf"`

---

## Development Best Practices

### 1. Keep Branches Focused

- One feature/fix per branch
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes
- Keep branches short-lived (merge within a few days)

### 2. Commit Frequently

- Commit logical units of work
- Don't wait until everything is perfect
- Small commits are easier to review and debug

### 3. Test Before Pushing

```bash
# Run the development server
npm run dev

# Build the project (check for errors)
npm run build

# Run tests (when available)
npm test
```

### 4. Keep Your Branch Updated

Regularly sync with `main` to avoid conflicts:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-branch
git merge main
```

---

## Example Workflow

Here's a complete workflow for adding a new feature:

```bash
# 1. Start from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-stats-dashboard

# 3. Make changes
# ... edit files ...

# 4. Stage and commit
git add src/pages/Stats.tsx
git commit -m "feat: Create stats dashboard page layout"

# 5. Continue working
# ... more edits ...

git add src/components/stats/
git commit -m "feat: Add completion chart and heatmap components"

# 6. Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/add-stats-dashboard

# 7. When feature is complete, merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/add-stats-dashboard
git push origin main

# 8. Clean up
git branch -d feature/add-stats-dashboard
git push origin --delete feature/add-stats-dashboard
```

## Quick Reference

### Common Commands

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# See all branches
git branch -a

# Switch branches
git checkout <branch-name>

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b <branch-name>

# See changes
git status
git diff

# Delete local branch
git branch -d <branch-name>

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

### Emergency: Need to Switch Branches with Uncommitted Changes?

```bash
# Stash your changes
git stash

# Switch branches
git checkout other-branch

# Come back and restore changes
git checkout your-branch
git stash pop
```

## Questions?

If you're unsure about the workflow:
1. Check this document
2. Review [TODO.md](TODO.md) for project structure
3. Look at recent commit history: `git log --oneline`

---

**Remember: Always use feature branches. Never commit directly to `main`.**
